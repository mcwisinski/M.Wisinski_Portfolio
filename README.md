# Liscensed Clinical Social Worker

### About Me 
Hello! I am an experienced college student and childcare professional with over 3 years of proven expertise in sociology and family (child) development. 


With skills in organization, communication, empathy, and leadership I am able to complete assignments, communicate with professors, and maintain an internship. I am adept at using Outlookâ€™s OneDrive, Excel, and SPSS. 


My invaluable skill set, commitment to quality work, and passion for social justice make me a valuable asset.  In my spare time, I like to read historical fiction and go for outdoor walks.
